Hi, I'm Louis.  Most anything to do with computers has always been a hobby of mine.  While pursuing a job that I love has failed twice for me, perhaps the third time
is the charm as I pursue a career in computer science.  I am currently on what is _hopefully_ my final semester of my master's degree.  I thought the summa cum laude I
got in my undergraduate has properly prepared me... it had not.  But the finish line is in sight.

For COSC 6397, this is me doing the readme file from the github assignment.
